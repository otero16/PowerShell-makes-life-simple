# PowerShell-makes-life-simple
Just my personal PowerShell codes for work and mostly fun

Don't take life seriously in the end nobody will leave alive from it.

Same as my code, this is just the first lines of a full of typo's errors extremely simple code that can help or not with what you need.

My code will never include 

1. Meaning of life

2. Rights over my soul 

3. Answers to you math problems

4. The formula explaining how to turn led into gold

All the above has been said and done before so do not expect anything like that in my code.

Reading my code will give the obligation to:


1. Buy me one beer. More than one can cause warm beer and i really don't like that.

2. Give me a praise in Linkedin

3. Test My code and if you find errors be so kind to comment that

Well having all said lets get-coffee, oh my i need to a function for this command now...

See ya... :)
