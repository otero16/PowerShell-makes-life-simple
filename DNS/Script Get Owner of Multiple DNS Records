# Description:

# This is intended to be excuted on DNS servers locally, and only present information with the goal of filtering the results in Excel
# No changes are intended to dns records with this script
# Before running this script please take a DNS server backup, stay home be safe do backups

# Inspired by: https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Get-Owner-of-Multiple-DNS-5d421631 WICH IS A REALLY GOOD ALTERNATIVE TO THIS

# More descriptions:
# Outputs all DNS records where a hostname resolves to an IP address if there are CNAMES or other records that do not resolve to one IP address then it will not be processed 
# Output is  written to both console and csv file 
# Filename is determined from the zonename you have selected
# This script will export the selected Forward and Reverse DNS zones on the local server
# This is sensitive to show errors when you have a subdomain zone with the same name of the root domain zone, for example contoso.com.contoso.com
