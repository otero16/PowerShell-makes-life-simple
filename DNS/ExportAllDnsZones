# Description:
# Outputs all DNS records where a hostname resolves to an IP address
# Output is grouped by DNSzone and written to both console and csv file
# Filename is determined from the zonename and each zone will generate its own file
# This script will export all Forwarding DNS zones on the DNS server selected
# The format of the output will include only (Hostname,IP)
