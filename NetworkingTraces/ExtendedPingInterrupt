The goal of the following function is because is see that a lot of people wonders how to control the infamous ping -t command on the internet using only powershell scripts
It is not as useful as many alternatives out on the internet, the goal for me was to control one command that will run continously until stopped 
Trying to answer this question without telling you to use test-netconnection as any reasonable guy will do, i am going to tackle the control of the ping -t command over powershell
It took me a while to realize that we cannot send a Ctrl+break since the ping command will never be completed
As well tried to use Start-sleep with no success maybe i just dont know how to use this
Then tried to hit my brain with a mug of joe 
Nothing seems to work as i want, why something so simple is so hard, i mean is only ping right?
Until i learn that Jobs exist in powershell, yes i know my powershell level is still in 0
Nevermind i am happy after writing this function my powershell level is still 0 nonetheless gained 1 EXP. IT IS A WIN FOR ME!!!!
Still needs polishing like declaring a function and requesting the ip address and documenting the function properly even so that is something for the juan of tomorrow

$IPv4 = "8.8.8.8"

Start-Job -Name Script { ping -t $using:IPv4 | Foreach{"{0} - {1}" -f (Get-Date),$_} } 

$Job = Get-Job -Name Script

Read-Host -Prompt “Press enter to stop”

Stop-Job -id $Job.Id

Receive-Job -id $job.Id -wait -AutoRemoveJob > c:\ExtendedPing-$env:computername.txt
